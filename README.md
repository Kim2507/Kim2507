# About me :girl:

Hi, my name is Kim. I love Lego since I was a kid and I enjoyed the feeling when finishing off building them.

I think that is why I started having passion about building software and appplications. One thing I love most about Software Developement is I can bring my creative ideas into life and I can be the one who make it comes true. 

I am an open-minded life long learner as technology definitely keeps innovating. I believe open-source learning brings extremely huge power to any of us. So feel free to connect with me if you would like to!  :sparkling_heart:
